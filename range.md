We operate a 42-target range as well as a full practice range.
The range is broken down into three 14-target NFAA courses: the Open course, the Lower course, and the Hill course.
Each course has it's own unique feel.
The Lower course takes you back and forth across a valley to the lowest point in our course at an elevation of 1,476 feet.
Take a hike through the redwoods on the Hill trail where you'll shoot through trees and off cliffs as you summit Oakland's highest point at an elevation of 1,820 feet.

Each of our courses are [marked for multiple yardages](/files/rebomarkers.pdf) so we can rotate Hunter, Field, and Animal targets between our three courses.

The range is adjacent to the Chabot Space and Science Center, so for a good idea of the weather before you come, see the
[observatory weather station](http://www.chabotspace.org/weather-station.htm).
