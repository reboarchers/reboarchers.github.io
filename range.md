We operate a 42-target range as well as a full practice range.
The range is broken down into three 14-target NFAA courses: the Open course, the Lower course, and the Hill course.
Each course has it's own unique feel.
The Lower course takes you back and forth across a valley to the lowest point in our course at an elevation of 1,476 feet.
Take a hike through the redwoods on the Hill trail where you'll shoot through trees and off cliffs as you summit Oakland's highest point at an elevation of 1,820 feet.
