This year's Western Roundup will be held on Sunday, June 28.
Get the flyer [here](/files/Western RoundUp 2015.pdf).

One year the circus train derailed in Oakland.
Many potentially scared and therefore dangerous animals were loose in neighborhoods and the Oakland Hills area.
The circus and law enforcement agencies needed experienced marksmen and stalkers to help “round up” these valuable animals.
Among those asked to help were the Redwood Bowmen of Oakland.
After all the valuable animals had been returned, and it was time for the club’s annual June shoot they decided to remember their contribution to the safety of the community by naming their shoot the “Western Roundup.”

The shoot consists of 28 3D targets, ranging from 10 to 100 yards.
There are 3 arrows per target with 11-10-8 scoring.
