We offer classes through the [East Bay Regional Parks Department](https://apm.activecommunities.com/ebparks/Activity_Search?ActivityCategoryID=13&isSearch=true&applyFiltersDefaultValue=true).
Classes are two hours long.
We cover safety and technique in our cozy club house,
then, we move out to the range where you can hone your new skills under the watch of our trained instructors.
Finish the class off with some fun with balloons.

To participate in a class, first sign up using the EBRP signup page link above.
That allows you to reserve a time and date (reservations are required) and receive
documentation, including waivers, that you must bring with you.
Sign up early because classes fill up fast!

We supply equipment for the class. You may bring your own bow, but we reserve the right
to inspect your bow for safety and appropriateness.
We may ask that you use our equipment in any case.

Youth (up to and including 16 years) must have an adult guardian present during the class.
