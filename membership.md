The Redwood Bowmen Archery club has maintained this course for the public since 1939.
Members get exclusive use of the clubhouse with many amenities including a stocked kitchen, bow-tuning equipment, club bows, BBQ pit, and great camaraderie.

### Monthly Events

The club members come together for three events every month.

On the second Friday of the month, we hold the board meeting at 7:00 p.m. and the club meeting at 8:00 p.m. at the clubhouse, often around our cozy fire pit.

Club shoots are held on the second Sunday of the month.
Registration opens at 8:30 a.m. and arrows fly at 9:30 a.m.
Club shoots are open to all, so feel free to come by enjoy the course with fellow archers.

Keeping our course looking great and working well requires some love and care.
Members come together on the Saturday before the club shoot to do keep the range in tip-top shape.
Work starts at 9:00 and ends with a home-cooked meal.

The next few monthly events are shown in this table, see the [calendar](/calendar/) further below
